//! Reclaim what no living view points at (standard invariant 8).
//!
//! A Plugin exists once (`plugins/<id>`) and declares which packages it needs. For
//! each installed declaration the host keeps one *view*
//! (`dependencies/views/<id>/<declaration digest>`) whose links point into the
//! shared store (`dependencies/store/<package>/<version>`). A package version may
//! be shared by many views, and a view becomes garbage the moment the Plugin's
//! declaration no longer maps to it.
//!
//! Two passes, in this order, because a view is what references a store entry:
//!
//! 1. remove orphan views — directories under `views/` that no *installed* Plugin's
//!    current declaration resolves to;
//! 2. recompute and remove every `store/<package>/<version>` that no remaining
//!    (living) view references, then the package directory if it is empty.
//!
//! Nothing here is optimistic. A declaration that cannot be read, a view that
//! cannot be walked, an unexpected shape under `views/`: all of them mean "this
//! might be referenced", and then nothing is deleted at all. Deleting is the
//! exceptional outcome, and the report always says what was kept and why.
